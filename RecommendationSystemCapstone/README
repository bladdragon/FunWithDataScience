Requirements:
  An introduction to the design of recommendation systems using
  collaborative filtering. Assumes basic knowledge of linear
  algebra, computer science, and convex optimization. Warm-up,
  lab, and analysis sections require the student to write MatLab
  code.

Contents:
  PDF:                Overview, instructions, and analysis questions.

  src/ratings.mat:    Contains MovieLens 1M data set in sparse matrix
                      form and a lookup table (description below).

  src/main.m:         Main entry point for the lab. Contains code for
                      splitting data set into training and testing,
                      running each algorithm, validating results on
                      the testing set, and calculating prediction
                      error.

  src/neighborhood.m: Function that implements a user-user
                      neighborhood method. See code documentation
                      for details. Called by main.m.

  src/sgd_bias.m:     Function that implements a latent factor model
                      using stochastic gradient descent. Model also
                      includes bias terms. See code documentation
                      for details. Called by main.m.

  src/svdpp.m:        Function that implements SVD++ algorithm using
                      stochastic gradient descent. Model includes
                      bias terms and implicit data. See code
                      documentation for details. Called by main.m

Data set:
  This lab uses the MovieLens 1M dataset originally found here:

  http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/

  ratings.mat contains a 6040 (users) x 3952 (movies) ratings
  matrix and a lookup table that contains the list of movie ids
  for which each user has provided prior ratings.
